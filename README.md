Heya! I'm CosmicTailz!

I like to make resource packs for both Minecraft Bedrock and Java editions, but I'm also working on my own standalone version
of Minecraft entirely via Scratch. It's based on an old project made by Griffpatch in 2013 called "Paper Minecraft".

I'm slowly learning how to make GUI-changing resource packs for Minecraft Bedrock edition from looking at the inner workings
of pre-existing ones. Then I try to incorporate it into some of my own personal projects, one of which I'm hoping to release
sometime soon.

I try to help some people online with resource packs and such, and I'm hoping to help some of the bigger creators such as
CrisXolt with concepts and such. Lots of my ideas might get rejected, but that won't stop me from trying my best!

I'm currently working on a Minecraft Bedrock Edition resource pack called "Xenon UI", which is a sorta "in-between" pack
between CrisXolt's "4JD UI" pack, and AgentMindStorm's "Console Aspects" pack, both of which I suggest you go and check out
for yourself! :D
